Machine Learning Project
========================

Overview
--------

- Network subclass will accept byte data
- Network subclass product a result
- Result will be evaluated
- Network will update its configuration based on 'better' or 'worse' grade
- The process is repeated until satisfaction is met

Research
--------

- This project is similar to py-geno except that networks of neurons construct
  organisms and learning is customizable instead of random
